Passwords are the most common tpe of authentication used today.  

Brute force attacks can be very slow because every character combination must be generated  

Passwords can provide strong protection if developed correctly.  

Its all about the number of symbols to choose from and password length  

Passwords Bottom Line 
- Use at least 1 upper case, 1 lower case, 1 digit and 1 special character in every password  
- Make passwords minimum of 13 characters long-but vary the length for different passwords  
- Repeat characters to make them easier to read and remember  
- Mix up repeating character patterns  
- Write passwords down AND protect that information as you do other critically important info
- Only change a password if you have reason to believe it has been stolen  
- Consider using an online password manager  
  - Dashlane, LogMeOnce, LastPass, Bitwarden, 1Password, Keeper, RememBear
- Look for default passwords on all digital devices and change
