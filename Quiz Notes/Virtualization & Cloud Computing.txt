When setting up a server virtualization environment, what component below manages the virtual machine operating systems and supports one or more guest systems?
- Hypervisor

A hypervisor is a virtualization manager that can perform:
- Controls the host processor and resources
- Allocates what is needed to each operating system
- Makes sure guest operating systems (called virtual machines) cannot disrupt each other

__________ is used to improve IT throughput and costs by using physical resources as a pool from which virtual resources can be allocated.
- Virtualization

The ability to run multiple operating systems on a single physical system and share the underlying hardware resources is the definition of ______?
- Virtualization

Primary difference between Virtual Machines and Cloud Computing is _____?
- Services

Sandboxes and Virtual Machines both use virtualization technologies.

What is "the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage and computing power, without direct active management by the user" called?
- Cloud Computing

Cloud Computing Service Models:
- Software as a Service (SaaS)
- Platform as a Service (PaaS)
- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
- Security as a Service (SECaaS)

Which of the three Cloud computing service models allows a customer to access software provided by a vendor using a web browser, without any installation, configuration, upgrading, or management from the user?
- Cloud SaaS (Software as a Service)

In what type of cloud computing does the customer have the highest level of control?
- Cloud Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

Essential characteristics of Cloud Computing:
- measured service
- broad network access
- on-demand self service
- rapid elasticity

Everything that happens in a Virtual Machine (VM) stays within the VM.  Therefore -  any downloads, changes, updates, installations ... anything ... created/saved within the VM is only accessible through the VM in some way.
