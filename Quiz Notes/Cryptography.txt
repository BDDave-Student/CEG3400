______________ is a universal technique for providing confidentiality for transmitted or stored data that needs a strong encryption algorithm and a single, shared key
-  Symmetric Encryption

Digital signatures are used to provide message authentication and non-repudiation.

The purpose of a __________ is to produce a "fingerprint" of a file, message, or other block of data.
- Hash Function

A stream cipher is a symmetric cipher that typically runs faster than other types of ciphers and has relatively low memory requirements.

Block ciphers and Chain ciphers are the two primary types of ciphers.
- False;  Stream and Block Ciphers

A cryptographic hash must always be used with ones private key to create a digital signature.
- False

Which cryptographic tool is used to guarantee the integrity of a message?
- Cryptographic Hash

Which of the following is not one of the functions of a digital signature?

In which type of encryption is the same key used to encrypt and decrypt data?
- Symmetric

If the only form of attack that could be made on an encryption algorithm is brute-force, then the way to counter such attacks would be to __________ .
- User Longer Keys

What is needed to mitigate the biggest weakness/vulnerability of using public/private key systems to authenticate or verify an entity's identity?
- trusted third part to verify an entity's identity claim

Which of the following is used to guarantee the authenticity of a message?
- digital signature

Characteristic of a Cryptographic Hash Function:
Fixed Size: output digest (hash value) is always the same size
Deterministic: same message always results in same hash
One-way: easy to compute
Collision-Resistant: hard to find two messages
High Fidelity: small change to message should change has value

A __________ is created by using a secure hash function to generate a hash value for a message and then encrypting the hash code with a private key.
- digital signature
