Physical Security Goals:
- deter potential intruders
- detect intrusions and monitor/record intruders
- distinguish authorized from unauthorized people
- delay, frustrate and ideally prevent intrusion at

IDS/IPS Systems:
- IDSs/IPSs can analyze more and different types of data than firewalls 
- firewalls must be faster than IDSs/IPSs
- packet level firewalls only inspect packet headers whereas IDSs/IPSs can inpsect packet payloads
- Application level firewalls are much more similar to IDSs/IPSs than packet level firewalls.

Type of Intrusion Detection System
- Rule Based Intrusion Detection: uses signatures to detect malicious software
- Heuristic Based Intrusion Detection:  experience-based techniques
- Statistical Based Intrustion Detection:   builds a profile of normal and uses it to detect anomalous events or software

DLP systems examine data in one of several states:
	- Data-in-use
	- Data-in-transit
