ATT&CK:  Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, & Common Knowledge
- MITRE ATT&CK
- documentation of common TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Precedures)
- globally available
- Four main issues:  Adversary behaviors, lifecyle, applicability to real env, common taxonomy
- Real world attacks, not research
- Best offense is best defense
- Adversary Emulation tool
- Tactics are the why
- Techniques are the how

CAPEC and ATT&CK
